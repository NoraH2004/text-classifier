In a superb location it is ideal to get out into the countryside by foot or by bike.  \\nEdith and Mario are lovely and couldn't have been more helpful during our stay (from looking up train times to giving us an earlier than normal breakfast).  The rooms are comfortable, clean and have plenty of room for bags and spreading out.\\nBreakfast is incredible and a highlight of any stay at 't Materke.  Ideal to fuel a day's bike riding.  Mario and Edith also have secure storage for bikes at 't Materke so perfect for visiting cyclists.\\nWe will definitely be visiting again!\"]"
